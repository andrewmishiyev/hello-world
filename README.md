# hello-world
I'm trying to learn how to code, so I can be smarter (:
Currently studying Business Administration, trying to learn how to code to expand my knowledge onto different areas that I wanna become comfortable with because it seems like coding is the future with technology, and learning how to code would be a great assest to have.
